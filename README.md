# Customer Segmentation Analysis of UK_Retail Sales Data

**Conducted customer segmentation analysis based on Recency, Frequency and Monetary (RFM) value**

**What is Churn Rate?**
Churn Rate: the percentage of people who abandon your service over time
Churn Rate = (Number of churns during period) / (Number of customers at beginning of period)
Average Customer Lifespan = 1/(churn rate)

### RFM is a methosd used for analyzing customer value

**1. Recency: How recently did the customer purchase?**
  - The last time that a customer made a purchase
  - A customer who has made a purchase recently is more likely to make a repeat purchase than a customer who hasn’t made a purchase in a long time

**2. Frequency: How often do they purchase?**
  -  How many times a customer has made a purchase within a given time frame
  -  A customer who makes purchases often is more likely to continue to come back than a customer who rarely makes purchases

**3. Monetary: How much do they spend?**
  - the amount of money a customer has spent within that same time frame
  - A customer who makes larger purchases is more likely to return than a customer who spends less

Therefore, by segmenting your customers with RFM, you’ll be able to analyze each group individually and determine which set of customers has the highest customer lifetime value (CLV)
  - The lifetime value of a customer, or customer lifetime value (CLV), represents the total amount of money a customer is expected to spend in your business, or on your products, during their lifetime
